# Go SDK Sample

This simple application demonstrates how to set up the Trinsic SDK to start verification flows and read their results. It sets 4 server endpoints that an UI application can call
to launch verifications.

## Dependencies

- [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id): Our API library that makes it easy to start accepting digital IDs in your application
- [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/): A Go web framework built on top of Fasthttp
- [godotenv](https://github.com/tonerdo/dotnet-env): A minimal dependency to autoload `.env` files into the environment's variables

## Setup

This sample depends on the `ui-web` sample. It serves static files generated by that application. So before you run this, make sure to run `npm install` and `npm run build` inside the
[`ui-web/samples`](../../../ui-web/samples/) folder.

### Running the project

Create a new `.env` file to set your Trinsic Access Token. You can use [`example.env`](./example.env) as a reference. If you need more information where to find this token, visit our [Getting Started](https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/getting-started-with-trinsic-connect) guide.

After you created your `.env` file you are good to run the project

```sh
# Running:
go run .

# Building:
go build -o sample && ./sample
```
