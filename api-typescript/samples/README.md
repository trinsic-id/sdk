# TypeScript SDK Sample

This simple application demonstrates how to set up the Trinsic SDK to start verification flows and read their results. It sets 4 server endpoints that an UI application can call
to launch verifications.

## Dependencies

- [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id): Our API library that makes it easy to start accepting digital IDs in your application
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): An unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js

## Setup

At this repository's root run `npm ci`. This sample depends on the `ui-web` sample. It serves static files generated by that application. So before you run this, make sure to run `npm run build` inside the
[`ui-web/samples`](../../ui-web/samples/) folder.

### Running the project

Run `npm ci` to install the necessary dependencies.

Create a new `.env` file to set your Trinsic Access Token. You can use [`example.env`](./example.env) as a reference. If you need more information where to find this token, visit our [Getting Started](https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/getting-started-with-trinsic-connect) guide.

After you created your `.env` file you are good to run the project.

```sh
npm start
```
