# PHP SDK Sample

This simple application demonstrates how to set up the Trinsic SDK to start verification flows and read their results. It sets 4 server endpoints that an UI application can call
to launch verifications.

## Dependencies

- [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id): Our API library that makes it easy to start accepting digital IDs in your application
- [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/): Slim is a PHP micro framework that helps you quickly write simple web applications and APIs
- [phpdotenv](https://github.com/vlucas/phpdotenv): Loads environment variables from `.env` to `getenv()`, `$_ENV` and `$_SERVER` automatically.

## Setup

This sample depends on the `ui-web` sample. It serves static files generated by that application. So before you run this, make sure to run `npm install` and `npm run build` inside the [`ui-web/samples`](../../../ui-web/samples/) folder, and then copy the contents of the generated `dist` directory into `api-php/samples/server/public`.

### Running the project

Make sure to create a new `.env` file to set your Trinsic Access Token. You can use [`example.env`](./Sample/example.env) as a reference. If you need more information where to find this token, visit our [Getting Started](https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/getting-started-with-trinsic-connect) guide.

After you created your `.env` file, install the sample's dependencies by running `composer update`. After which you should be good to start the application:

```sh
php -S localhost:3000 -t public
```
