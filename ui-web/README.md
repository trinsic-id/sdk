# Trinsic Web UI Library

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@trinsic/web-ui.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/@trinsic/web-ui)
[![Build Status](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/actions/workflows/ui-web-release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/actions?query=branch%main)

The Trinsic Web UI Library provides ways to launch verification sessions directly from your web frontend in the browser.

This library must be paired with an [api library](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk#api-libraries) as part of a full integration.

## Documentation

See the [Trinsic docs](https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/) for more detailed information on how to start integrating with our identity acceptance network.

## Installation

Install the package with:

```sh
npm install @trinsic/web-ui
```

If you're using a CDN, for example unpkg, you can use the below source.

```html
<script src="http://unpkg.com/@trinsic/web-ui"><script>
```
## Usage
### Setup
The library exports three methods: `launchIframe(launchUrl)`, `launchPopup(launchUrl)` and `launchRedirect(launchUrl, redirectUrl)`.

#### Bundler
When using a module bundler import the functions as follows:

```js
import { launchIframe, launchRedirect, launchPopup } from "@trinsic/web-ui";
```


#### Script Tag
When using a direct script tag, you can access the methods via the global `TrinsicUI` variable:

```js
await TrinsicUI.launchIframe(LAUNCH_URL);
```

### Launch a Session
First, retrieve a launch URL from a trusted backend that can reach out to the Trinsic servers and create sessions. [See our API libraries.](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk#api-libraries).

Then, launch the session using one of the three methods exposed by this library:

#### `launchIframe`

Call `await launchIframe(launchUrl)` to launch the Session as an embedded floating iFrame in-page.

This method returns a promise which will resolve when the Session is completed (successfully or unsuccessfully) or aborted by the user.

#### `launchPopup`

Call `await launchPopup(launchUrl)` to launch the Session as a popup.

This call functions similarly to `launchIframe` -- it will return a promise which will resolve when the Session is finished.

#### `launchRedirect`

Call `launchRedirect(launchUrl, redirectUrl)` to launch the session by redirecting the user's browser window. This is similar to an OAuth flow.

This method has no return value, and cannot be awaited in the same way `launchIframe` and `launchPopup` can.

When the user completes or aborts the Session, they will be redirected back to your application at `redirectUrl`, with the following query parameters appended:

- `success`
  - Can be `true` or `false`
  - Whether the Session completed successfully
- `resultsAccessKey`
  - May not be present (e.g. if the Session was aborted)
  - Must be processed by your backend to fetch the final identity results for the Session
- `sessionId`
  - The ID of the session that the user is redirecting back from


For example, calling `launchRedirect(launchUrl, "https://example.com/trinsic-redirect")` will cause the user to be redirected to `https://example.com/trinsic-redirect?success=true&sessionId=...&resultsAccessKey=...` upon completion of the Session.

***Note:** These parameters can be set to arbitrary values by curious or malicious users simply by editing their browser URL bar. Don't implicitly trust the `success` parameter -- always fetch the Session results from your backend to confirm. Similarly, keep a record of the session ID you sent the user to, and correlate it against the `sessionId` query parameter.*


You can find a full example of an app using this library in the [samples](https://github.com/trinsic-id/sdk/tree/main/ui-web/samples) folder.

## SDK Versioning

Our SDKs follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) ("SemVer") scheme.

For example, the version number `1.13.0` has a major version of `1`, a minor version of `13`, and a patch version of `0`.

Breaking changes are only introduced alongside a new major version.
