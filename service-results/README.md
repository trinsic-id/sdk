# ServiceResults Project

The ServiceResults project provides standardized result handling and exchange functionality for the Trinsic SDK across all supported languages and platforms.

## Overview

This project consolidates the result-handling patterns that were previously scattered across individual SDK samples, providing:

- Standardized result exchange request/response models
- Common result processing utilities  
- Consistent error handling for result operations
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Usage

Each language-specific directory contains implementations that can be used in the corresponding SDK samples. The implementations follow the same patterns and interfaces for consistency across platforms.

### Common Features

All implementations provide:

1. **ExchangeResultRequest** - Standard request model for result exchange
2. **ResultProcessor** - Utility class for processing session results
3. **ResultExchanger** - Service class for exchanging result access keys
4. **Error handling** - Consistent error handling across platforms

## Integration Examples

Working integration examples are available in the SDK sample applications:

- **C# Sample**: `api-csharp/samples/server/Sample/` - Shows enhanced error handling and batch processing
- **TypeScript Sample**: `api-typescript/samples/server/src/` - Demonstrates validation and async operations  
- **Java Sample**: `api-java/samples/server/trinsic/` - Includes async processing and validation routes

### New Routes Added

The integration examples add several new routes to demonstrate ServiceResults capabilities:

- `/exchange-result-enhanced` - Enhanced error handling with result insights
- `/exchange-multiple-results` - Batch processing of multiple result exchanges
- `/validate-result-request` - Request validation without exchange
- `/exchange-result-async` (Java) - Asynchronous result processing

## Integration

To integrate ServiceResults into your SDK sample:

1. Copy the appropriate language implementation to your project
2. Update your routes/endpoints to use the ServiceResults classes
3. Replace direct API calls with ServiceResults utilities

See individual language directories for specific integration instructions.

## Benefits

Using ServiceResults provides:

- **Standardization**: Consistent patterns across all language implementations
- **Validation**: Built-in request validation with meaningful error messages
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging capabilities
- **Batch Processing**: Support for processing multiple requests efficiently
- **Type Safety**: Full type safety and IDE support where applicable
- **Testing**: Example test patterns for validating implementations

## Language-Specific Features

Each implementation includes language-specific enhancements:

- **C#**: Data annotations, async/await, dependency injection support
- **Java**: Jakarta validation, CompletableFuture async support, thread safety
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety, Promise-based async, batch operations
- **Go**: Context support, goroutine concurrency, interface-based design
- **PHP**: Modern PHP 8+ features, framework examples (Laravel, Symfony)
- **Python**: Dataclasses, async/await, type hints, concurrent processing
- **Ruby**: Thread-based concurrency, gem packaging, framework examples

## Contributing

When adding new features or fixing issues:

1. Update all language implementations to maintain consistency
2. Add appropriate tests and examples
3. Update documentation in both the main README and language-specific READMEs
4. Ensure integration examples demonstrate the new functionality
